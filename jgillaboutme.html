<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Hi there,
	My Name is Joseph Gill. I am a Game Associate at GameStop&reg; I was hired in November of 2014 and plan to stay with the company until I can complete my education. I am attending the Miami Valley Career Technology Center (the MVCTC) for Game Programming and Web applications, although my home school is Wayne High School in Huber Heights OH. Even though I am at the MVCTC I am a member of the Wayne Marching Band. My long term goal in life is to have my own game studio. I plan to go to either Sinclair community college, the University of Utah, West Virginia University, or Full Sail University for entrepreneurship and game design. Anyway that just a little bit about me, thank you for visiting my website and if you would like to know more, please feel free to visit the “About Me” page located in the Navigation Pane at the top of the page.
								Joseph M. Gill
